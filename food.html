            <h3>Jollof Rice</h3>
            <p>Chicken used to be reserved for special events such as Christmas dinners, but economic growth has made it one of the favourites at almost every local restaurant. Ghanaians like their chicken with a side of jollof rice. Jollof rice is spicy rice dish so popular all over West Africa. There is a great debate between Nigerian and Ghanian Jollof rice. Ghanaian jollof rice is made with basmati rice which is also known as Thai Jasmine rice. The basmati rice is not parboiled. Parboiling makes it soggy.</p>

          <h3>Waakye</h3>
          <p>In it's simplest form Waakye is a mix of rice and beans, however there are often so many sides added to this dish. Some of these sides include gari (cassava powder), stewed meat or fish, fried pieces of kelewele (plantain), salad, shito sauce (made of chillies), dried fish and even spaghetti in it. Waakye is most often prepared by women who cook all the ingredients in the early mornings and then sell it on the street, wrapped in banana leaves or given out in a take-away box.</p>

          <h3>Banku and Tilapia</h3>
          <p>Banku and Tilapia is perfect for fish lovers. The most common fish to eat in Accra is the freshwater tilapia. The whole fish is either fried or grilled and then served with a side of banku. Banku is a pasta-like mass cooked out of fermented corn and cassava. Many locals recommend grilling the fish instead of frying as it tastes better and is healthier. Banku can be eaten with various sauces such as stew, hot pepper sauce, soup etc.</p>

        <h3>Fufu & Soup</h3>
        <p>One of the most popular dishes across the whole of Ghana. Plantain and cassava (sometimes yam instead) are cooked and then pounded until the dough has the required consistency to be moulded with your right hand into a palatable portion that can be easily dipped into one of the many soup variations on offer. Two of the most famous soups served with fufu are groundnut soup (based on peanuts) and 'light soup', which is rich in tomato and often with goat meat.</p>

        <h3>Red-Red</h3>
        <p>Red-red is a simple stew based on black-eyed beans that get cooked in palm oil and tomatoes. It's topped with fried plantain pieces, which are shimmering red and the reason for the second 'red'. Red-red is a popular street food dish alongside waakye. Many street food stalls and restaurants in Accra will prepare this dish without any broth from meat or fish. If you want to be sure to avoid meat and fish, ask them if they use meat or broth from meat, fish or stock cubes in their stew.</p>

      <h3>Kelewele</h3>
      <p>Kelewele is fried plantains that have been seasoned with a variety of spices and served alongside a stew or even just on their own. This simple dish should definitely be on your list of top street foods to try when in Accra. Fried plantains like kelewele show up all over the world like in Nigeria (called dodo), South America and the Caribbean, and Asia.  Kelewele is sometimes referred to in Ghana as the “vegetarian meat” because of it’s popularity among vegetarians.</p>
